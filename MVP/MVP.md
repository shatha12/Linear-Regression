# Predicting Laptop Prices Using Linear Regression

Based on the analysis done, I came to conclude that these features are the most relevent in deciding the price:

- The bigger the RAM size, Screen size size the more expensive it is.

- laptops with touchbar are more expensive then laptopts without touchbar
