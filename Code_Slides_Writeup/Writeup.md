# Predicting Laptop Prices Using Linear Regression

## Abstract
Estimating the right price for a laptop is a very important process, so to find a solution for the issue this project started. 
The goal of the project is to create a model that predicts the prices of laptops based on several known data. 
This model can be useful for people who wants to buy a new laptop, and they want a model to predict the price of laptops. Automating the pricing process will help in getting a closer estimate for the actual prices in the market and will help in reducing many expenses.

## Design
The dataset contains around 1300 with 12 features, Some of the features were dropped 
and other grouped into more general categories.

## Data
The dataset contains around 1300 with 12 features, 
The data was scrapped from Jarir.com the predictions of used laptop prices were drawn from multiple features such as RAM, Screen Inches, Storage, Touchscreen, .


## Algorithms
Pre-processing
1- Remove extra unnecessary details.
2- Created plots to visualize the relationships between the target and predictors, and between the variables themselves.
3- Decided which features to keep and which to drop.

## Feature Engineering
1- Convert some columns into Numeric Values
2- Convert some categorical variables into dummy variables
3- Split data to train and test data.

## Models
1- Several linear regressions, Polynomial regressions ,  RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR were developed,
2- Pick and choose the best model with the right number of features to avoid the complexity and error.

## Model Evaluation and Selection
1- The dataset observations of 1300 were split into 80/20 train vs. test.
2- The evaluation of our models was based on R2 score.

## Tools
Tools: 
- Python, and Jupyter Notebook 
- Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Selenium , Pandas, Numby, Sklearn, and Matplotlib ,Seaborn.
