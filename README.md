# Predicting Laptop Prices Using Linear Regression

Pencils, paper and crayons? No, this year’s most important back-to-school supply is a computer/Laptop
How much you need to spend to get a computer with a good battery and a webcam that can keep on trucking for three or four years?
In this project I’m going to do web scraping from the noon.com KSA website then linear regression to predict the laptop prices.

## Question/need:
How much does a laptop cost ?
The purpose of this project is to help predict laptop prices


## Data Description:
This data will be scraped from noon store in KSA and it will contain the important features for The laptop 
Like : laptop Name , core , Inch , RAM , Color ,Brand ,Price

## Tools

•	BeautifulSoup :collect data from website 
•	Pandas : Explore and Clean data , 
•	Matplotlib, seaborn :visualize data and models 

## MVP Goal :
The aimed output of the prediction modelwould have a throughout report with expected or predicted affordable laptob prices for the students , this would be achived using linear regression model then selection and evalution the best model using ttesting methods on web scrapped data from noon  KSA.
