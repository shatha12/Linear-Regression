# Predicting Laptop Prices Using Linear Regression

Pencils, paper and crayons? No, this year’s most important back-to-school supply is a computer/Laptop
How much you need to spend to get a computer with a good battery and a webcam that can keep on trucking for three or four years?
In this project I’m going to do web scraping from the jarir.com website then linear regression to predict the laptop prices.

## Question/need:
We need to estimate the laptop cost based on the laptop features.

## Data Description:
This data will be scraped from jarir store in KSA and it will contain the important features for The laptop 

- Company Name
- Product Name
- Laptop Type
- Screen Inches
- Screen Resolution
- CPU Model
- RAM Characteristics
- Memory
- GPU Characteristics
- Operating System
- Laptop's Weight
- Laptop's Price

## Tools

- selenium :collect data from website 
- Pandas : Explore and Clean data , 
- Matplotlib, seaborn :visualize data and models 
- sklearn : train models

## MVP Goal :
The aimed output of the prediction model would have a throughout report with expected or predicted affordable laptob prices for the students , this would be achived using linear regression model then selection and evalution the best model using testing methods on web scrapped data from jarir.
